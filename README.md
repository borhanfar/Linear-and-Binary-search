# Linear-and-Binary-search
Compare the number of operation 
## Explanation
Number of operations in linear search could be as many as the length of the list. Linear search does not need a sorted list, has a simple algorithm ( sequential access ) and compares one item at a time. Therefore , it will be slow.
However, strategy in binary search definitely reduces the number of operations. Binary search does need a sorted list, has a complex algorithm ( random access ) and avoids searching half of the list. As a result of that, it reduces the searching time and will be faster. 
For instance, in bl_printed_music_500 .csv file, linear search for finding the 1965 in the Publication date ( standardised ) column proceeds with 167 operations whereas binary search has 5 operations.
